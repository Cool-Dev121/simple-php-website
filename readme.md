# Simple PHP Website

I put together this project while introducing to PHP a good friend of mine. I decided to clean it up a bit and put it on Github so anyone new to PHP can have a taste of a very simple and minimal website built with PHP.

## Variables

```php
$variable = 'Value';
```

## Functions

```php
function funcName()
{
    global $variable;
    
    echo $variable;
}
```

## Lisence

MIT
